# Project-1

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX.

Using the pokeAPI, I have made a little website that requests information from the API based on user input. 
Upon receiving this information the web page is able to create cards and populate each card with information for each pokemon. 
The information displayed includes the pokemon's number, name, and official artwork.
Upon clicking on one of the pokemon, a modal pops up with a larger image of the pokemon, its name, and its types associate with that particular pokemon. 
I decided not to put the pokemon's number again inside here, as it feels redundant and unimportant. 


The live site in question: https://upbeat-galileo-c1cce5.netlify.app/


When giving the website new input, the previous pokemon are cleared out before new ones are introduced.
The use of relative units (for the most part) keeps the website rather responsive on mobile.
